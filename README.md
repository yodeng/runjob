runjob
========================

Summary
=======

runjob is a program for managing a group of related jobs running on a
compute cluster.  It provides a convenient method for specifying
dependencies between jobs and the resource requirements for each job
(e.g. memory, CPU cores). It monitors the status of the jobs so you

is used in the login compute node.
