        ========================
        
        Summary
        =======
        
        runjob is a program for managing a group of related jobs running on a
        compute cluster.  It provides a convenient method for specifying
        dependencies between jobs and the resource requirements for each job
        (e.g. memory, CPU cores). It monitors the status of the jobs so you
        can tell when the whole group is done. Litter cpu or memory resource
        is used in the login compute node.
